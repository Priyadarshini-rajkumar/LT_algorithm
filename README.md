This algorithm can be used to generate ranked lists of candidate galaxies within LIGO/Virgo localisation regions. 
The algorithm performs the following operations :
1.  Calculates the percentage of GW Skymap obsevable from a particular location  
2.  Load galaxy catalogues/ GW Bayestar Maps
3.	Filter the galaxy catalogs based on the GW error map provided by LIGO/ Virgo GW detectors 
4.	Produce a ranked list of candidates by combining GW error-map probability, observability, distance, and absolute magnitude data 
5.	Provide a "probability of success" estimate to help make a go/no-go decision on triggering the plan
6.	Create an observing schedule based on the time available for observation.
7.	Send the observing plan to LTâ€™s fully autonomous Database to begin EM follow-up.
